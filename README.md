# Valence Coordinator SDK

The Valence Coordinator SDK is a Rust crate for building off-chain coordinators
for the Valence Protocol.

It enables developers to create and manage programs that interact with and
extend the capabilities of the Valence Protocol, supporting both Cosmos and
EVM-compatible blockchains. Solana support is coming soon.
